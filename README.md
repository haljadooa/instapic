# Archiving InstaPic

Creating and maintaining InstaPic has been an amazing experience, I've learned so much valuable information from this project alone... You truly do learn by doing.

Anyway, the reasoning behind my decision is there's an abundance of already established Instagram downloaders out there... it doesn't make sense to devote valuable development time to something that's already been made numerous times. So as a result, I decided to abandon it. The live version will be taken down on July 28th, 2018.
